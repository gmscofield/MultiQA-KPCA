Britain 's Millennium Dome will close down this coming Monday after a year of mishaps. Officials at London 's Millennium Dome say the structure will close down after a final of New Year's Eve party. They say it will be likely sold to a developer and be turned into a Technology Park . Problems riddled the Dome even before its grand opening last New Year's Eve. Construction delays and cost-over runs hurt the project, which was originally expected to cost at least 1 billion 300 million dollars. Dome officials had to seek an additional 265 million dollars to complete the structure .
