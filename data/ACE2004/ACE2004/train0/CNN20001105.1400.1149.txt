duane walker , "cnn headline sports." week ten of the nfl season, and for the first time in a washington redskins uniform, jeff george will get the starting nod at quarterback against the arizona cardinals . brad johnson is out because of a sprained knee ligament. 

i would think where we 're at that brad will be out of the game. my guess is -- i mean, i 'd like him to be at least be able to dress, but i 'm not sure he 'll even be able to do that. if we where he s and be an emergency third , that would probably be the best we could hope for.
