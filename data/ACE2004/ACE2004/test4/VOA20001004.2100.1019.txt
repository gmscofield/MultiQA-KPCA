A Venezuelan Ford execute says Firestone hid information about tyre defects from Ford and should be held responsible for more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country . Hector Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan consumer protection agency that Bridgeton Firestone knew about the tyre defects for many months and should be held responsible for the accidents. In a letter to the consumer panel a spokesman for Firestone said the company 's appearance at Wednesday's hearing would have implied fault, which it denies. The Venezuelan government panel wants both Ford and Firestone to compensate victims of accidents caused by Ford vehicles equipped with Firestone tyres. Some 46 people have died on Venezuelan highways in accidents caused by the vehicles .
