Afghanistan 's Taliban faction and the opposition Northern Alliance have agreed to peace talks sponsored by the United Nations . The UN special envoy for Afghanistan Franchesco Bendrel says the world body has received separate letters from the two sides , pledging to participate in the negotiations with serious intent and to not abandon the process unilaterally. Mr . Bendrel says he hopes to begin the talks next week, probably by shuttling between the two delegations at first. If the talks go well, they would then move to indirect talks in the same city and finally face-to-face negotiations.
