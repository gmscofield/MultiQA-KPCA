at the supreme court tonight -- important questions about medical testing and privacy rights of individuals . when can doctors tell police they 've discovered evidence their patients are committing crimes? here's nbc 's pete williams . 
 reporter: 
it's a case that pits a woman 's medical privacy against the state 's desire to protect children . faced with an epidemic of cocaine use by pregnant mothers who were potentially putting their babies at risk, the medical staff at this charleston , south carolina , hospital came up with a novel idea -- decide which of the pregnant where things went wrong. we need doctors to act like doctors , not doctors to act like police . 
 reporter: 
but the state defends it as a way to get mothers off drugs, reducing the risk of having unhealthy babies . i went over and looked at these babies when this case started. we 're talking about a 3 1/2-pound human being . it would make you cry. 
 reporter: 
the question for the court -- when can doctors tip off police ? justice scalia said -- doctors routinely report when they find gunshot wounds. why not when they find proof of drug use? but justice ginsburg asked -- how can the hospital say it 's protecting unborn children by arresting women after they give birth? many of the nation 's big medical groups oppose the south carolina policy. they say the threat of arrest will frighten more women away from pregnancy care, further endangering their babies . if the justices uphold the south carolina policy, many of the nation 's doctors fear they 'll be called on to report more crimes, eroding the trust between them and their patients . pete williams , nbc news , at the supreme court .
