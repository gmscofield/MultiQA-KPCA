Major League baseball 's National League champion New York Mets fortified their team s leadership on Tuesday by resigning Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips . One of the Mets owners , Nelson Doubleday told a New York newspaper that Valentine 's contract was for three years at $7.5 million and with Phillips was for three years at $3 million. The fifty-year-old Valentine replaced Dallas Green as the Mets manager on August 26th, 1996. Since then, he has led the team to four consecutive winning seasons, including back-to-back post season berths and the franchise 's first trip to the World Series in 14 years. Valentine said he knew he wanted to stay in New York . 

We think after the last game when Mike and Fonse and Alan John amongst the others , came in and literally asked me to stay. That I knew at that time, probably could have offered a lot less, that I was going to stay. 

Valentine had been under contract through midnight Tuesday, while Phillips was under contract through December. By resigning Valentine before his contract expired, the Mets avoided a bidding war for his services. The Cincinnati Reds had expressed an interest in him and the Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Toronto Blue Jays are also without managers .
