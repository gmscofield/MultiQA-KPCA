I 'm David Coler , VOA News . Three Florida courts are weighing cases that could signally end in the month-long battle for the White House . Decisions were expected swiftly with the December 12th deadline for Florida to certify its 25 electors , the people who will actually choose the next US President . Thursday, lawyers for Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W Bush were subjected to intense grilling in a Florida Supreme Court hearing on the Democratic candidate 's appeal of the rejection of his request for a recount. His chief lawyer David Boyz says whatever the court decides, the state 's deadline will be met. 

I think that what they have consistently said is that they expect this to be over by December 12th. We believe it can be over by December 12th. And if they come out with an order that says we are not going to count any ballots, that's going to resolve by December 12th. If they come out with an order that says we are going to count the ballots, we 're going to start now, we believe that can be resolved by December 12th. 

At the same time, the Bush legal team made its final arguments in a challenge by Democratic voters who want thousands of absentee ballots thrown out. If the challenge succeeds, it could more than reverse the Texas Governor 's 537-vote lead.
