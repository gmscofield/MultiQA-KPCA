mr . bush has yet to take office. how will it be once he takes arge? one writer asked today, will black americans be eternal victims ? will mr . bush and millions of blacks be permanently estranged? here is abc 's john martin . 

as usual, it took a comedian to say what many americans are thinking. 

give bush credit. you realize bush has named more black people to his administration than voted for him . 

today, george w. bush signaled his intention to mend fences with black americans . 

i 've got a lot of work to do, but i welcome the opportunity. i look forward to the chance. 

georgetown law professor sheryll cashin worked in the first clinton white house . will it be important for him to reach out? will it be necessary? 

yes. maybe not necessary, but definitely important. 

important for several reasons. republicans hold only a five-vote majority in congress . so the 38 black votes lined up by this member , eddie bernice johnson , will be crucial. she is the new chair of the black caucus . 

the consequences of his ignoring us means his programs will not probably be successful. 

mr . bush wants to build bridges to the white house and gain support among blacks . the question is whether that's feasible without antagonizing his political base . black leaders say without bush 's support on the issues which matter to them , they will mobilize and work extra hard to get the vote out next time in even greater numbers for the democrats . john martin , abc news , washington .
